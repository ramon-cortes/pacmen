### Pacmen    <img src="images/PacMan1.png" height="50" width="50">

Creates images (Pacman) on the screen. The user can choose the amount of Pacmen to create.
Pacmen will have a random starting position and speed. They will bounce around the screen acording to those parameters.

### Extra

I added a "squishy" effect when the pacmen reach left or right borders. Pay close attention to their aspect when they are about to bounce horizontally.

### Installation

Images are pulled from a relative folder */images*
